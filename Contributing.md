# Contributions Welcome

Please make sure you install this repo's dependencies using NPM or Yarn prior to submitting a pull request:

```bash
yarn
# or
npm -i
```

Please note that contributions will be carefully vetted because this is a sample repo; in general, the idea is that this is to be used as a starting-off point for making your own customizations, and as such I cannot promise that all contributions will be accepted.
